# Image



Enhanced img tag with multiple image fill modes, support for loading hint, loading failure hint.

## Import

```tsx
import { Image } from '@nutui/nutui-react';
```

## Demo

### Basic Usage

The basic usage is the same as that of the native IMG tag. You can set the native attributes such as SRC, width, height, and Alt.

:::demo

<CodeBlock src='h5/demo1.tsx'></CodeBlock>

:::

### Object Fill

The `fit` attribute is used to set the image filling mode, which is equivalent to the original `Object-fit` attribute.

:::demo

<CodeBlock src='h5/demo2.tsx'></CodeBlock>

:::

### Object Position

The position property can be used to set the position of the picture, which is equivalent to the original Object-position property when combined with the FIT property.

:::demo

<CodeBlock src='h5/demo3.tsx'></CodeBlock>

:::

### Round

The round attribute allows you to set the image to be round. Note that if the image is not contained and fit is contained or scale-down, a full circle cannot be contained.

:::demo

<CodeBlock src='h5/demo4.tsx'></CodeBlock>

:::

### Loading

The Image component provides a default loading prompt and supports custom content through `slotLoading`.

:::demo

<CodeBlock src='h5/demo5.tsx'></CodeBlock>

:::

### Error

The Image component provides a default loading failure warning and supports custom content through `slotError`.

:::demo

<CodeBlock src='h5/demo6.tsx'></CodeBlock>

:::

### Image + text

`Image` and text

:::demo

<CodeBlock src='h5/demo7.tsx'></CodeBlock>

:::

### LazyLoad

The Image component provides lazy loading of images, which can be realized by configuring `isLazy`, which is not enabled by default.

:::demo

<CodeBlock src='h5/demo8.tsx'></CodeBlock>
